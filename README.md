Requirements:

Authentication:

Firebase Email/Password login for organizations

Protected routes — only logged-in orgs can access the dashboard

Optional: generate cleanup QR code for verification

UI Design:

Built with React + TailwindCSS

Simple, clean, and mobile-friendly dashboard layout

Map embedded next to each report card (Google Maps API)

Deliverables:

Component code (OrgLogin.jsx, OrgDashboard.jsx)

Firebase auth and Firestore integration
